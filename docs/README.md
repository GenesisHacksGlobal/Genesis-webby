## Core principle

Genesis is an experience-led website, but visual ambition must stay within a measurable performance budget. Every contribution should preserve:

- a clear mobile experience;
- keyboard and reduced-motion accessibility;
- adaptive quality for expensive rendering;
- route-level code splitting;
- predictable ownership through the layered architecture;
- clean teardown of listeners, observers, animation frames, and GPU resources.

When documentation and implementation disagree, update both in the same pull request.
